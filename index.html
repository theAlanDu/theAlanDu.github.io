                <h2>
                    <p>After graduating with my undergraduate degree, hopping on a plane two days later to start a
                        hectic month-long trip around Europe, and finally coming back home, I sat there and started to
                        apply for jobs. I browsed around LinkedIn and Indeed to see what was available, and as I kept
                        scrolling down and down, not many jobs really interested me. It made me wonder, if I actually
                        wanted to find a job in the field of my degree. </p>
                    <p>During my time at the university, I did fine academically, but I didn’t feel emotionally invested
                        in it. I didn’t wake up in the morning excited to go to class or run out of class after lecture
                        anxiously rushing to sit down and do my homework. Instead, I went home, thought about how I had
                        even more class the next day, and wondered how many days were left until the weekend. “That’s
                        just how I am, unable to feel too excited about things. It’s normal for me. It’s how I am.” I
                        would tell myself and then I would go through the motions.</p>
                </h2>

                <h3> <em>I'm always trying to figure out life.</em></h3>

                <h2>
                    <p>During and after my trip around Europe, I was confused. Here, it was supposed to be a trip people
                        dream about going to. Then there’s me, I went through the motions. I searched for the top things
                        to do in an area. I saw all the massive architecture that popped up seemingly out of nowhere as
                        I exited a random alley, I ate food specialized in the area, and I socialized. But at the end of
                        each day, I sat there and thought about it. I asked myself, “Did you find that enjoyable? Did
                        you have fun?” Being honest with myself, I didn’t really think so. “Must just be how I am.”</p>
                    <p>A habit I have is searching Reddit or asking others about their thoughts on how things are
                        supposed to be. If someone else has fun, I want to know how they're doing it and what makes
                        their
                        experience different. I'm always trying to figure out life, so I asked. I asked my friends, and
                        I looked at various posts. <em>If you traveled to Europe, what would you do for fun?</em> It’s a
                        question I’ll probably be asking everyone from now on. Of course, there are going to be varying
                        answers.</p>
                    <p>Back to my job search, I've scrolled past so many job postings, and I’m struggling. Not because I
                        don’t know the motions to find a job. Not because my resume is weak. Not because my GPA is low.
                        It’s much more difficult than that. It’s because I don’t find the excitement in the work. I have
                        a fear that it will be a job where I wake up and dread getting out of bed to get to. Where I
                        count the days until the super short 2-day weekend to start it all over again. So here I am. I’m
                        not sure why I’m learning to code a website or posting a long story about myself. I
                        <em>should</em> find a job. But, here I am. I want to find that thing everyone else probably
                        does: good old-fashioned fulfillment. The drive to do what makes me want to get out of bed in
                        the morning.</p>
