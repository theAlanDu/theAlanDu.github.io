            <p><h3>There’s a myriad of issues that I experience quite often with the above scenarios. To list a couple,
                there are the problems due to ideas of “should” and optimization.</h3></p>

            <p><h5> <strong>Should:</strong></h5></p>

            <p><h3><strike>I guess I should explain.</strike> For some reason, I like to explain things to people. Sometimes
                they really
                don’t care, and during those sometimes, I don’t care that they don’t care. So, I continue explaining
                anyways, it makes me happy.</h3></p>

            <p><h3>See what I did there? Well, let me explain.</h3></p>

            <p><h3>According to whatever dictionary Google uses, “should” is a verb “used to indicate obligation, duty, or
                correctness, typically when criticizing someone’s action.</h3></p>

            <p>
                    <h3>To me, should is a word that has an underlying tone. It says, despite my current desires and willingness
                to do something, because the general public consensus and opinion is to do this action, a thought has
                crossed my mind to do this action. In other words, the motivation to do this action preceded by the word
                “should” is not because of one’s own motivation.</h3></p>

            <p><h3>I live for examples, so here a couple and possibly a better way to word it:</h3></p>

            <p><h3><em><strike>I should do my laundry.</strike></em>
                <br>I’m going to do my laundry so that I can have clean clothes to look and feel fresh for whatever’s
                next.</h3></p>

            <p><h3><em><strike>I should do community service.</strike></em>
                <br>I signed up for community service because I want to help a just cause.</h3></p>

            <p><h3>Just to further explain this one, one’s own motivation does not have to be a selfish motivation. The
                motivation simply must come from a reason that the person truly agrees with. </h3></p>

            <p><h5>Optimization:</h5></p>
            <p>
                <h6><em><br>*Notices dishes in the sink*

                        <br>Alright, I should do the dishes.

                        <br>*1 hour later*

                        <br>Let’s see, to do the dishes, I should rinse the dishes first, organize the dishes by type,
                        soap the
                        plates,
                        rinse the plates, neatly organize the plates on the rack, then repeat for the bowls, then repeat
                        for the
                        utensils, and finish off by cleaning the pans.

                        <br>Ugh that is so much work, do I really have to do this?

                        <br>*1 more hour later*

                        <br>Okay, I’m here. Just like I planned. I really don’t want to do all this work.

                        <br>*10-15mins later*

                        <br>Thank goodness I’m done with that.

                        <br>*Next time I have to do dishes*

                        <br>Ugh, I really hate doing the dishes.

                        <br>*Repeat*</em></h6>
            </p>

            <p><h3>How many times have I done this? Probably almost every time I’ve done the dishes. Maybe it’s in my
                genetics or maybe it’s social conditioning, but I always have to find a way to do it faster so that
                I can get it over with, so I focus on the task and how to make it faster. Optimization, right?</h3></p>

            <p><h3>According to whatever dictionary Google uses, optimization is “the action of making the best or most
                effective use of a situation or resource.” It actually sounds great. By making the process faster
                and more efficient, I suffer less.</h3></p>

            <p><h3>Of course, I’m going to tell you otherwise. I mean I did set it up like that after all. So, what’s
                wrong with optimization? Well, in the end, the optimization is probably being done incorrectly. Most
                likely, time is being optimize, but the mental energy (which is also a resource) is being wasted,
                and the emotions are running negatively. During the planning phase, listing out every single action
                for this task could be a good idea, but at the same time, it lists all the work that has to be done.
                When menial tasks are listed out, it can easily demolish morale. The next thing you know, you’re
                discouraged about doing the dishes.</h3></p>

            <p><h3>Before I give you my view on how to get through this task, here’s a quote from Art Williams:</h3></p>

            <p><h3>“…I found two things out about smart people. I think it's almost impossible for a smart person to win
                in
                business in America today, because I find smart people spend their whole lifetime figuring things
                out.
                They always trying to figure out an easier way, and a quicker way. And another thing I found out
                about
                smart people, is they just don't get around to doing nothing.”</h3></p>

            <p><h3>I’m easily guilty. Easier, faster, less time, less suffering. Sign me up. Anyways, I think Art misses
                the opportunity to expand a bit more on why the smart people don’t get around to doing anything. He
                mentioned using time to figure out how to get things done, but he never mentioned morale.</h3></p>

            <p><h3>Back to the dishes, the following approach can be used:</h3></p>

            <p>
                <h6>*Notices dishes in the sink*
                    <br>Alright, I’m going to wash these dishes so that next time I cook, everything is available to
                    use.
                    <br>Since this is such a menial task, I’m mentally going to focus on something that needs more
                    thought.
                    <br>*Right there and then*
                    <br>*Does dishes, and think about how to implement smoother transitions on my Website*
                    <br>*15-40 mins later*
                    <br>Alright, I finished the dishes.
                    <br>*Goes to improving personal website with new ideas*</h6>
            </p>

            <p><h3>Of course, not everyone is coding a website, but the idea to expand on other aspects of life that are
                more interesting to you, while doing the menial tasks. In terms of physical time, an extra 5-30
                minutes
                may have been used to wash the dishes, but, in reality, the entire time was used to think about a
                more
                interesting challenge, and because of that, the morale probably stayed the same or increased.</h3></p>
