        <h1>Making this Website</h1>
        <h2>It’s kind of dark. I’m in my room doing the same thing I have been for the past few days. I’m staring at a
            bright screen. I sleep at 4am and wake at 11pm, and for the last 72 hours, I’ve been on and off about
            building my first website. I’ve been going in circles, making small edits on things I thought were good
            enough, struggling on the simplest tasks, like resizing a button. All the meanwhile, I’ve been listening to
            random podcasts about how these successful speakers changed their thinking and made it in life. “Why are you
            making a website?” A few of my friends asked me as I sent them my URL, excited to show off my shoddy work.
