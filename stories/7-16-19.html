        <h1>A Snippet in the Mindset of a Runner Up</h1>
        <h2> How a Tennis Legend deals with it</h2>
        <h3>
            <p>“Did Federer really take Nadal out in the semi-finals of Wimbledon?!” I asked one of my friends whom I
                play tennis with every now and then. He then proceeds to send me a highlight video hosted by ESPN, and
                of course, I had to watch it. First off, good work on ESPN with these highlights, the superb video
                quality and actual coverage of the match is levels beyond those given by in the past years by official
                grand slam YouTube channels. Second, <em> wow</em>. The rallies between the two players were immense.
                Seeing the explosive movements from both players contrasted by the damping of the grass made it seem as
                if they were moving so gracefully, yet from my experience, I have an idea of how much energy it takes to
                move that quick. <em> A lot. </em></p>

            <p>After the highlights, I asked my friend when the finals were: Sunday. <em> Who?</em> Djokovic vs
                Federer. A few days pass, the match finishes, and he sends me the highlights. <em> Damn. </em> As a
                Federer fan, I must say, that must’ve hurt. A five-hour match ending in the longest way possible, the
                fifth-set tiebreak—a new rule at Wimbledon. Again, great quality highlights. Sadly, the results were in
                the title of the video, but of course, I had to watch it regardless. A close first set lost by Federer
                in the tiebreak, returning to win the second quickly, only to lose another tiebreak in the third, only
                to win another set in the fourth by a break—and then, in final set, with Federer having two match points
                to win it, Djokovic perseveres and brings Federer to the 12-all tiebreak and closes it out.</p>

        <h3>
            <p><em> Damn. </em> I sat there and thought: “I have to watch the post-match interviews. How does a world
                class athlete handle such a loss?” Luckily, there’s a stream on YouTube. I laid there in bed and
                listened as Federer explained how he felt about the two match points he could have won to take the
                championship and about his loss:</p>

            <p>
                <h6>“No, not really. I was still happy to be at 8-all, 9-all? You try to see the positives, you try
                    to take
                    it as a good thing—you’re not down a break, or the match is not over yet…You just always try to push
                    yourself to see things on the better side, but yes it was definitely tough to have those chances…You
                    take it on your chin. You move on, and you try to forget and try to take the good things out of this
                    match—there’s tons of it. And…think, ‘well it’s not that bad’ but for now, it hurts, and it should…I
                    think I’m very strong at being able to move on. I don’t want to be depressed about an actually,
                    amazing
                    tennis match.”</h6>
            </p>

        <h3>
            <p>Listening to his words, his tone, and seeing his body language, it’s apparent that Federer feels the pain
                of losing such a close match, as he, himself, clearly stated above. But also apparent is Federer’s
                mindset
                on losing. Despite the pain, his mindset is one of trying to see the positives in the shortcomings. When
                he
                lost the points that could’ve have won him the match, it was better than being down a break, and when he
                finally lost it, it was better to take the good things from the match and appreciate it for what it
                was—and
                it was—an amazing match. It seems like the next time I fail, I’ll have to look at the takeaways as well.
