        <h2> Oh the struggles.</h2>
        <h3>
            <p>It’s kind of dark. I’ve been in my room doing the same thing I have been for the past few days: I stare
                at a bright screen, I sleep at 4am, I wake at 11pm, and for the last 72 hours, I’ve been on and off
                about building my first website. And all the while, I’ve been listening to podcasts about how these
                successful people changed their thinking for the better.</p>
        </h3>

        <h3>
            <p> “Why are you making a website?” A few of my friends asked me as I excitedly sent them the URL to my
                webpages. <em>C’mon, why do I do anything?</em> Damn. It’s a hard question. Here I am, staring intently
                at the small gap on my webpage thinking: <em>I really cannot get rid of that gap. Is it the
                    padding?</em> Possibly. <em>Is it the width?</em> Nope. After trying out so many things, I finally
                find it: It’s the invisible bullet points from the unsorted list. What a struggle.</p>

            <p> It might just be another phase I’m going through. I recall a year ago, I did the same thing: I went onto
                YouTube and searched up “Motivational Videos” and watched a few. <em>Take action, it’s a numbers game,
                    discipline, schedule your life, get up in the morning and just go.</em> And yet, within a few weeks
                after that, it was back to the same schedule again. Go to school, get home, shower, tennis, watch my
                animes, eat, and repeat. So much for that motiv—Ahh fuck it. I don’t care, let’s try it again anyways.
            </p>
        </h3>
        <h4>
            makes me think about life—and not in the typical way</h4>
        <h3>
            <p>Lately, I’ve been listening a lot to this pretty well-known “motivational” speaker, Tony Robbins. I put
                motivational in quotes because he says he isn’t a motivational speaker. Instead, he presents himself as
                the “why” guy. I’ll go into more depth <a>later</a> about his key points, but for now, I must say, he
                makes me think about life—and not in the typical way I usually do.
            </p>

            <p>So why am I making a website? Because it’s an experiment regarding what Tony Robbins has been talking
                about. I’m using this website as both an outlet for thoughts and a test to see if I can use a
                restructured thought process to make this happen.
            </p>
